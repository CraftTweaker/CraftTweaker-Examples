/*
 * EXERCISE
 *
 * Calculate the date for easter following the algorithm Gau√ü published 1816.
 *
 * The algorithm goes as follows:
 *
 * a = year mod 19
 * b = year mod 4
 * c = year mod 7
 * k = year div 100
 * p = (8k + 13) div 25
 * q = k div 4
 * m = (15 + k - p - q) mod 30
 * n = (4 + k - q) mod 7
 * d = (19a + m) mod 30
 * e = (2b + 4c + 6d + n) mod 7
 * easter = (22 + d + e)
 * 
 * The resulting number is relative to the 1st of March, so the 32nt March equals the first of April.
 * Write the algorithm in a function and verify that it works with some years.
 *
 * Note: "div" is the integer division
 * Note: "mod" is the remainder of an integer division
 *
